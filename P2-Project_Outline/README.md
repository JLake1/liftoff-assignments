## Submission Instructions

### Overview

This app will serve as a locator and directory for St. Louis food trucks. Due to the roving nature of the business, where trucks are changing location on a daily basis, customers are often limited to checking a specific truck's Facebook or Twitter feed in order to find it. That issue will be addressed by providing a comprehensive guide to all local trucks and their day-to-day locations and time spans. 

Additionally, the app will allow truck owners to set up profile pages with their relevant information and social links. They will be able to enter upcoming dates/times/locations for their trucks, which will be displayed on the daily feed/tracker.

### Features

Daily locator: Truck locations and times will be displayed and updated for the current day. This will initially be a text feed, but ideally will integrate a map as well.

Trucks directory/filter: A directory of all registered trucks, displayed as tiles or a list. Users will be able to filter this list by category (cuisine, type of food, desserts, etc.).	

User(Customer) login: Users will be able to register, login, and setup a profile page.

User favorites: Users will be able to add/remove their favorite trucks, with a favorites list displaying on their profile page.

Owner login: Truck owners will be able to register, login, and setup a profile page.

Create a truck "event": Owners will be able to submit the location that their truck is serving on a given day, along with start and end time. This will be displayed on both their profile page (list of current and upcoming events) and on the main feed.
